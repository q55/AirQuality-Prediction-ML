# 🌍 AI-Based Air Quality Classification

This project applies **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** techniques to classify **Air Quality Index (AQI)** levels based on pollutant concentrations and geographic data. The dataset includes city-level AQI readings with pollutant-specific values.

## 📌 Algorithms Used:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Cross-validation for model evaluation**

## 🔧 Features:
✔️ **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling  
✔️ **Model Training**: Implemented ML classifiers for AQI categorization  
✔️ **Performance Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrices  
✔️ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: K-selection for KNN, kernel selection for SVM  

## 📊 Results:
- **KNN** achieved **96.3% accuracy** (best performer)
- **CNN** reached **93.87% accuracy**
- **SVM** struggled with overlapping classes (**66% accuracy**)
- **Cross-validation** ensured generalization
